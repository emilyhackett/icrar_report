	Previous research has shown that the physicsal structural properties of dark matter haloes can correlate with their local environment (such as filaments and voids), as those of baryonic galaxies may do also, although to a lesser extent. The significance of this correlation is that it can be seen as evidence for the theory of hierarchical structure formation in large-scale structure (as well as possibly substructure), since it demonstrates the influence of major mergers on the structural properties of galaxies. The question this project aims to address is whether this similar correlation between large-scale cosmic web structure and physical characteristics of the smaller embedded structure exists for stellar halos. The stellar halo of a galaxy is an area in which this trend may be more easily examined, since they have long orbital time periods, little dissipation effects and exist in smoother potentials in the outer regions of galaxies. Shape properties for these stellar halos can be derived similarly to those for dark matter halos, by calculating the reduced moment of inertia tensor whose eigenvalues and eigenvectors correspond to elliptic major,intermediate and minor axes. These values can then be compared to the filamentary structure around and through the halo, which is defined as its' local environment, and measured using the DisPerSe program. We find that (...)

\section{Introduction}
\IEEEPARstart{T}{hrough} analysis of N-body hydrodynamical simulations in CDM cosmologies, clear correlation has been observed between the properties of dark matter haloes and their local environment within the cosmic web. This environment is defined by large-scale structures such as clusters, voids, filaments and sheets, along which the dark matter halo may tend to be aligned parallel or perpendicular. This alignment can be measured with respect to physical properties such as shape (via triaxiality, oblateness, prolateness or sphericity) or angular momenta and spin. Second order correlation has also been observed between different halo mass functions, redshifts and metallicity. Some evidence has been found of a turning point mass beyond which correlation of properties to environment vanishes or is reversed \cite{hahn07b} \cite{dubois14}. 

The shape of dark matter haloes can be determined by computing the moment of inertia tensor (whose eigenvectors are related to the lengths of the principal axes of inertia) \cite{hahn07a}. Hahn et.al \cite{hahn07a} found that haloes in clusters tend to be less spherical and more prolate, whereas halos in filaments tend to be more oblate, whilst finding overall that mass in low density regions show a clearer dependence on environment, and related these results to the temperature of the surrounding flow and infall of surrounding matter, which correlated with their environment classifications (as stable manifolds). 

The fact that these halo properties correlate with the local environment suggests that the baryonic galaxies that form within them likely do so as well \cite{hahn07b}.  Bullock and Johnston \cite{bullock05} propose a way to investigate the properties of galaxies within their local environment by examining the stellar halos of these dark matter halos, since halo stars allow for testing of galaxy formation theories by having long orbital time periods, little dissipation effects and smoother potentials. These offer an insight into the question of whether structure formation is truly hierarchical on small scales, such as within the stellar halo. If so, abundant substructure would be expected \cite{bullock05}. 

The particular large-scale hydrodynamical cosmological simulation used is the Horizon-AGN \cite{dubois14}, which has been previously used to show that more massive galaxies tend to be oriented perpendicular to the filament, whilst less massive are parallel. This was proposed to be because of the misalignment of galactic angular momentum during mergers, which have occurred with higher frequency in high mass galaxies. 

In this study, the shape of stellar haloes will be examined by making use of tidal torque theory. Linear tidal torque theory is essentially a way of calculating the angular momentum of a cosmological structure, by making use of the Zel'Dovich approximation, among others. It exists on the assumption that in the linear region of tidal torque, the Zel'dovich displacemnt can be written as separate spatial and temporal functions \cite{porciani02a}, where the spatial function is related to the tidal field tensor (deformation tensor) and the moment of inertia tensor, both of which can be calculated using available data. Re-arranging and approximating the potential as a second order Taylor expansion gives an expression for the angular momentum in terms of the deformation tensor, D (which can be calculated from the shear tidal tensor, T) and the moment of inertia tensor, I. 

The Horizon-AGN hydrodynamical cosmological simulation has already been used to investigate a number of different trends in galaxy spins (for example, their dependence on mergers for reorientation \cite{welker14}, or cross-correlation with the surrounding dark matter tidal field \cite{codis15}).

%%%%%% METHODS %%%%%
\section{Methodology}
\subsection{Reduced Moment of Inertia Tensor}
The physical shape characteristics of the stellar halo can be calculated in a number of different ways, all of which influence the resulting correlations made with the background filament. An important quantity for characterising shape is the moment of inertia tensor, which can be calculated iteratively for a set of particles as per Porciani \cite{porciani02a}. A more useful version is the reduced moment of inertia tensor \cite{tenneti15} which produces a direct correlation between eigenvalues and the principle axes of the assumed elliptic halo. The reduced inertia tensor was calculated for each halo cube according to the following equation:
\begin{equation}
	\tilde{I}_{ij}=\frac{\sum_n m_n \frac{x_{ni}x_{nj}}{r^2_n}}{\sum_n m_n}, \quad \quad \text{where} \quad r^2_n=\sum_i x^2_{ni}
	\label{eq:moitensor}
\end{equation}
Where the generalised $x_i$ coordinates are given with respect to the centre of mass of the halo, which was calculated iteratively for circles of increasingly smaller radii. From this reduced inertia tensor, the eigenvectors represent the principal axes of the halo ellipsoid, and the eigenvalues correspond to the square of the principal axes' lengths.
Since the reduced moment of inertia tensor produces a real symmetric matrix, the eigenvalues and eigenvectors were calculated analytically. 
\subsection{Shape Properties of Stellar Halos}
Using the values for the major, intermediate and minor axes of the elliptic halo, and their corresponding axis vectors, the following quantities were measured. 

\IEEEPARstart{}{Sphericity}: The sphericity of the object is defined with respect to the major and minor axis (the intermediate is ignore). 
\IEEEPARstart{}{Ellipticity}:

\subsection{Using DisPerSe to calculate filamentary structure}
The program DisPerSe \cite{sousbie11a}, standing for 'Discrete Persistent Structures Extractor' was developed by Sousbie et.al. to study the properties of filamentary structures in the cosmic web of galaxy distributions, by using the concept of persistence. The main idea is to find persistent topological structures within a data set, which can be of the form of an N-body particle set or a grid with values. These structures are identified as components of Morse-Smale complex of some input function defined over a manifold - this complex captures the relationship between the functions' gradient, its topology, and the topology of the manifold it is defined over. Further detail on this process is given in the Appendix.
The program DisPerSe outputs the skeleton structure for the given data set, which are plotted against the density background in Figure \ref{fig:1}. 
\subsection{Pawsey Resources}
The Horizon-AGN data set is located on the Pawsey Supercomputer Magnus in the scratch directory, and is currently being worked on by a PhD student looking to

\section{The Morse-Smale Complex and Persistence}
Critical points are discrete sets of points where the Morse function's gradient is null, and integral lines are curves tangent to the gradient field at every point. Integral lines cover all space and their extremities are critical points, which induces a tesselation of space into regions called ascending manifolds. The set of these ascending manifolds is the Morse complex of the function. The Morse-Smale complex is an extension of this concept - the space is tesselated into regions called 'p-cells', each of which is the intersection of an ascending and descending manifold. 
Topological components of a function can be represented by pairs of positive and negative critical points called persistence pairs - where a positive critical point corresponds to a created topological component, and a negative to a destroyed topological component. The absolute difference between the value of the critical points in a pair is the persistence, which represents the lifetime of the corresponding component. DisPerSe allows the specification of a persistence threshold which allows removal of topological components with persistence lower, hence filtering noise from the Morse-Smale complex.
