PERSONAL README:

This is the 'script' of sorts for the finalised ICRAR report to be submitted. Although initially the idea was for this to become a journal article, or in fact a proper research paper, it is not the end of the world if this does not occur! The main thing is to produce a paper that makes sense in its own right, that has a clear aim and interesting results from a range of data manipulation techniques.

General structure:
1. Introduction
	1a. What is the large scale structure?
	1b. Summary of previous research work on correlating structures
	1c. What is a stellar halo?
	1d. What are the implications of correlation between the two?
2. Method
	2a. Characterising the stellar halo
		i. Moment of inertia tensor
		ii. Eigenvalues and axes
		iii. Ellipticity, sphericity, triaxiality
	2b. Characterising the filamentary structure
		i. Summary of disperse program
		ii. Isolating values for the filament
	2c. Correlating the two (description of graphs)
3. Results
	3a. Where were correlations seen, where were they not?
	3b. What does this have to do with stellar halo rather than DM halo?
	3c. What further characteristics should have been explored?
4. Conclusion
